SendScreen sends a portion of your MAC (OSX) screen someplace via OSC.

Image is sent as a raw binary array, one ROW at a time of the format:
uint16 width, height
// row 0, ... row height-1
uint8 red, green, blue x [width*height]  	// per row


Usage:

// v0.01
Position the window over area to be echo'd to OSC
Output Size = Capture Size = HARD CODED! 
Output IP address and path = HARD CODED (command line?)

// Future -- 
OSC output info should be enterable
Capture size may be an even multiple of output size (+ / - )
When scaling down image will either be scaled (good for images) or
decimated (maybe better for digital effects)
